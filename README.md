# FJR.SmsSolution
The FJR.Sms library and FJR.SmsManager was originally written (by me) back in 2005, and has been collecting dust since then. However, after getting a question on StackOverflow I decided to refactor & release this under the [MIT-license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) (see MIT.txt).

Is a simple (but decent) SMS library written in C#. Use it together with a phone, connected to a COM-port (COM1, COM2, COM3, etc) to send SMS-messages!

# FJR.SmsManager
